			Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
			Side step, right-left, to my beat
			Get it, let it roll
			Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other
			Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad
			Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
			Straight up, I (got ya)
			Making you fall like that (break it down)

			Got the right body and the right mind
			Rolling up the party, got the right vibe
			Smooth like (butter), hate us (love us)
			Fresh boy, pull up and we lay low
			All the players get moving when the bass low
			Got ARMY right behind us when we say so
			Let's go
			Side step, right-left, to my beat (right-left, to my beat)
